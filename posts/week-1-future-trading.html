    <p>This was our first week working on the project, and it started off with great energy.</p>
    <p>The main goal for these first days was to <strong>get to know each other as a group</strong> and align expectations on how we’ll collaborate. Since our area of activity is <strong>Finance</strong>, after some discussion we decided that our main focus will be: <strong>Future Trading</strong>.</p>
    <p>At this stage, we’re taking our first steps in exploring the topic and looking for <strong>experts who can support us</strong>. We already have meetings scheduled for next week with <strong>three specialists</strong>: two with experience in trading and future trading, and one with broad experience in economics.</p>
    <p>Overall, it was a <strong>kick-off week</strong> marked by organization, important decisions, and lots of enthusiasm for the journey ahead.</p>
